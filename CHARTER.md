  Charter V0.9"

> Charter: This charter describes operations as a RISC-V DataCenter &
> Cloud Computing SIG.

# Vision

To enable the adoption of RISC-V into Datacenter and Cloud Computing.

# Goals 

The SIG will provide strategy and oversight for technology sectors
encompassing multiple industries and extensions in Datacenter & Cloud
Computing. This SIG will identify gaps across industries and RISC-V
groups and create TGs that will address these gaps.

-   What?

-   Propel RISC-V into Datacenter & Cloud Computing in all forms, CPU,
    > accelerator, DPU, SmartNIC,

-   Add new ISA, and support Platform OS-A, M

-   Enable DataCenter ecosystem, software stack, infrastructure

-   Connect with External RISC-V standards: e.g. Open Compute, Khronos,
    > ISO, OneAPI, CENELEC, MISRA

-   Connect with internal RISC-V groups:

-   targeted at general Purpose computing, multi-process compute,
    > heterogeneous and distributed computation

-   Aim for Horizontal servers (scaling out) which show up sooner then
    > vertical servers (Scaling up) and allow software to do adaptive
    > resource management, better for throughput

-   Who: We aim to connect with the builders, and users of Data Center
    > and Cloud computing with RISC-V technology

-   Which vertical segment (starting with but not exclusively):

-   Datacenter

-   Automotive, backend

-   Finance

-   Cloud Computing

-   Retail

-   Health Care

# Strategy/Focus 

The DataCenter SIG is intended to both develop an umbrella strategy to
holistically cover a number of the industries and task groups that share
the fact that they use RISC-V in a datacenter. The strategy will consist
of identifying the industries and groups in RVI and bringing them
together to coordinate their efforts and to identify and address gaps.
The group will also, through the technology HC, provide proactive and
reactive involvement, review, and sign off for spec and other documents
going to TSC-vote for approval.

The focus will involve Key Technology areas in Scope.

# Scope 

-   Other software ecosystems: x86 emulation, CPU, \...

-   Accelerator - Multiprocess general purpose

-   ISA improvements + cooling and power , \...

-   Ecosystem that requires tuning or porting for RV- software stack,
    > spark, hadoop, ML/AI, mapreduce,

-   Attributes: security, performance, RAS (Resource management), \...

-   RV Interactions: OS-A server extension,hypervisor, internal groups:
    > RAS, security, AI/ML, HPC, embedded; Virtualization and
    > Containers, \...

-   External interactions: OpenCompute: future Liaison, ...

-   Aim for Horizontal servers (scaling out) to show up sooner than
    > vertical servers (scaling up): Horizontal servers allow software
    > to do adaptive resource management (e.g. Amazon is more concerned
    > about throughput than latency) and prefer their own scheduler.

-   Future:

    -   dpu, smartnicc

# Deliverables

-   Strategy document for RVI-wide DataCenter efforts (not an approval
    > document),

-   List of gaps (and proposed resolution: new TGs, impact existing TGs,
    > etc.),

-   interface with external groups/Standards, and Representation with
    > other groups as appropriate to provide proactive input.

We expect existing members of some of these groups to join this SIG and
likely have representatives for this SIG in those other groups.

-   RASD

-   AI/ML

-   Security

-   HPC

-   Embedded

-   Tool Chain and Runtime

-   Graphics
