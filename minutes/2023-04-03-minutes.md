We have iterated on our NON-ISA plan for the last 3 month (since November 2021), and it is stabilizing with fewer changes. So now is the time to start writing our technical thoughts down concretely so that we can keep and maintain our institutional knowledge.

As discussed in the AI from the Mar 7 call, we have created a Technical Whitepaper template from which we will give detailed writeups on each feature in our Gap list. All this is in the RISCV DC/CC folder where you should all have write access if you are part of RISC-V:
o	datacenter+cloud-computing SIG - Google Drive

Disussed with Ventana (JM) using a website for the  ecosyste paper so that it is live.
