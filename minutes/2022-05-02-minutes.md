# Minutes
 
We have iterated on our NON-ISA plan for the last 3 month (since November 2021), and it is stabilizing with fewer changes. So now is the time to start writing our technical thoughts down concretely so that we can keep and maintain our institutional knowledge.
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBcRB41d0qZsVP6TrE9jnsPUQyoE493mgOoL75m5jeQ/edit#slide=id.g11528f3be56_0_19

As discussed in the AI from the Mar 7 call, we have created a Technical Whitepaper template from which we will give detailed writeups on each feature in our Gap list. All this is in the RISCV DC/CC folder where you should all have write access if you are part of RISC-V:
o	datacenter+cloud-computing SIG - Google Drive

We have started with several documents from which the DC/CC SIG members can copy for each feature (or they may combine feature into a major topic), and allow other members to help with the writing:
•	Original template: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UAk33wi3NMElGM_zCekdPa5eFRJCVQIaK1VhvQ3M67Q/edit 
•	DC/CC Main paper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuoUic-ORsc3UIGaUMsSRnY4UHogX1zuePH5QeJcjHQ/edit (Michael + others)
•	ISA and Infrastructure Improvement: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2Lwu7yW2p4eLky0bLhT9WaCBIx8XZs9aDfaeEO5pY4/edit
