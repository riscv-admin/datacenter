# Minutes
 
We have iterated on our NON-ISA plan for the last 3 month (since November 2021), and it is stabilizing with fewer changes. So now is the time to start writing our technical thoughts down concretely so that we can keep and maintain our institutional knowledge.
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBcRB41d0qZsVP6TrE9jnsPUQyoE493mgOoL75m5jeQ/edit#slide=id.g11528f3be56_0_19

As discussed in the AI from the Mar 7 call, we have created a Technical Whitepaper template from which we will give detailed writeups on each feature in our Gap list. All this is in the RISCV DC/CC folder where you should all have write access if you are part of RISC-V:
o	datacenter+cloud-computing SIG - Google Drive

We had a full meeting today talking about getting help in working on the collaborated whitepapers. I have already started the general Main paper and will focus on the Acceelerator paper.  I hope others can help with the other papers. All papers are in one place on the RISC google drive.  We plan to start 2 weeks meeting to increase the cadence of the editing drive. SO our next all will be Mar 16, same time.  Link to our agenda slide:

We started reading DC/CC Main paper.
Mark discussed the need for SOftware stack/ecosystem. This is covered in our paper on 
	Software ecosystem: 
o	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1njzeFWkVG-w9OXdKUYtHS_CHJeE2mgAZRnCaASRPSaI/edit 
DC/CC/Edge success requires software stack
Developers need to build on laptops, what is the stack that is important and available to day ( can port and optimize)
Clockworks and excalibytes building laptop chips for DC, based on RV, they use the laptop to do development instead of using SBC

Excalibyte is chromebook
Support linux is better then android/Yocto
What stack are needed for DC and have it ported on QeMU
