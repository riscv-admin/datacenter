# Minutes
  - reviewed draft charter 1.0 https://github.com/riscv-admin/datacenter/blob/main/CHARTER.md
  1.	We made every diagram editable directly in Google slide now which allows others to edit and add their suggestions
  2.	We have a gap list and from the gap list a prioritized list of top 3 items, all now in 8pt font
  3.	Slide 1:
Why is interrupt at the top?, message interrupt, fast interrupt for cloud services, they can only support NMI, mostly PC express devices; but there is already a spec in place, and it only needs to be ratified, so may be more priority on the longer term development items, MSI should be supported
IS it being worked on? Yes/No: 2 dimension metric; then what is the status of it
Not started yet items should be at top priority or add to existing started items
Alibaba cloud is one cloud, we need other clouds

Add QoS as part of Resource Management, on a per thread basis

Can we identify specific of improvement, but also separate out missing functionality

4. Slide 4
Send workload to cloud, but may not trust vmm, 
1.so need confidential computing 
2. 3rd party compute, provide fn in datacenter that operate on data from multiple parties, trusted computing sig supports no leaks
Generalize trust service to confidential computing

  5.	Next call is Apr 4 (still at the usual time 10 AM ET, 7 AM PT, 1400UTC and still will be every 4 weeks after March 7) to allow us to be 2 weeks ahead of the Board meeting. This will allow us to be prepared for future Board meeting cycles. 
  6.	In the next meeting ,we will have a chance to review all the contributors’ changes to the Plan.
    a.	Datacenter/Cloud Computing SIG non-ISA Plan - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBcRB41d0qZsVP6TrE9jnsPUQyoE493mgOoL75m5jeQ/edit
7. propose to start a collaborated writeup white paper on Datacenter/Cloud Computing, MIchael to start on Google doc, and others to help collaborate
