# Minutes
In the meeting, we share and discuss PMU and performance analysis methods in cloud, including multi-architecture X86 and ARM support, core/uncore PMU technologies, and RISC-V enhancement proposals.

Key Discussions:
1. Cloud Performance Analysis Challenges
- Complex workloads (hybrid deployments, multi-architecture hardware, low-overhead real-time monitoring needs).
-  Requirement for unified toolchains to enable full-stack analysis across x86/ARM/RISC-V.
2. CPU Bottleneck Analysis & Multi-Architecture Framework
- Topdown Analysis Model: Identify frontend (instruction fetch) and backend (resource dependency/memory latency) bottlenecks across architectures.
- PAS Framework: Lightweight toolchain (FrameScope/RTRadar) for instruction-level analysis on multi-arch platforms.
3. Advanced Core PMU Features
- BRBE (Branch Record Buffer): Optimize frontend bottlenecks (e.g., autoFDO improves database TPS by 16â€“22%).
- SPE (Statistical Profiling Extension): Pinpoint memory latency and false sharing issues (e.g., 8.6% performance gain in X265).
4. Uncore PMU & Unified Architecture
- CMN/DDRC/PCIe PMU: Monitor inter-die bandwidth, memory/IO latency.
- ARM Coresight Solution: Unified driver for uncore components (via APMT ACPI table for node extensibility).
5. RISC-V Proposals
- Proposal 1: Add core-level PMU to track end-to-end request latency (addressing DDRC metric blind spots).
- Proposal 2: Standardize uncore PMU specifications to reduce kernel driver redundancy (supporting ACPI extensions and overflow interrupts).

Next Steps:
Advance RISC-V proposals through community collaboration; enhance PAS framework for RISC-V compatibility.
