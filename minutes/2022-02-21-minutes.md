  2.	We have a gap list and from the gap list a prioritized list of top 3 items, all now in 8pt font
  3.	We plan to switch our next meeting to next Monday March 7 instead of March 21, (still at the usual time 10 AM ET, 7 AM PT, 1500UTC and still will be every 4 weeks after March 7) to allow us to be 2 weeks ahead of the Board meeting. This will allow us to be prepared for future Board meeting cycles.
