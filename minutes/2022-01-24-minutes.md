# Minutes
  - reviewed draft charter 1.0 https://github.com/riscv-admin/datacenter/blob/main/CHARTER.md
  - non-ISA plan
    - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBcRB41d0qZsVP6TrE9jnsPUQyoE493mgOoL75m5jeQ/edit
    - Slide: Gap list:
      Get original table, updatepercentage in future, btu focus on content + prioritization
    - Slide: Road to Success
      Move legend outside of box
      Move and use Link to original Board slides
      Build productive ecosystem, product software
      Both priv and non-priv part of ISA 
      See a lot of Challenge in building the software which is 90-95% in Arm-based server: cloud computing, search rec, are typical cloud apps, and everyone is trying to do cloud native
      Apps that support these are: AI/ML/DB, network
      Where to connect to vertical industries? 
      Below that are the base OS and middleware software to connect to HW, 
      generic product names like docker can be moved but also add other managed runtimes
      Change base OS into broad categories to make this more readable
      Do the binding in a backup slide
      Hyp/vmm missing components iommu, qos, vmiou, goes to backup slide on what is missing in HYP/VMM
      Virualization is a vertical topic, like iovirtualization, to virtualized storage devices
      May be change orange box to say: missing spec
      RAS/Protocols/trust services color may be wrong
      May be change name to :Ecosystem needed, no ratified spec
    - Slide: Priorities
      Make fonts 8 min
      ISA+ infrastructure improvements
      Numbers to give order? Top 3: virtualization/interrupt/RAS: rest is forth: Security needs to go first
      Resource Management includes QoS
      Is performance counter part of timer/counter? OK will add, also possible a new PMU sig under software
      Performance analysis are profiling tools, different from monitor

      Software:
      Many features in linux still not supported for cloud services
      Also order by 123

      Protocol standards:
      Launch new groups to figure other standards 
      Power + temp monitors
      Need 123, extras can go on 5 year gap
      Also what are they helping, why are we doing this
