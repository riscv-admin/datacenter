RISC-V Datacenter/Cloud Computing gaps
We continue to do our renewed 2024 GAP analysis, now collated in this spreadsheet under today's meeting date:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ZK5SeCgm_6U-O4DoKJwGA-3RvGEdJ2cQeLeu6HI-RI/edit

We mostly expanded on the nonvolatile memory requirements, as well as expanded on the background of RISE 
Everyone please add your GAPS to this list directly, send an email to this list if you like to explain your GAP and we can continue to discuss when we come together
The next call will be Mar 4 as Feb 19 is a US holiday.

 - Standing items
We presented at RV SUmmit NA joint with HPC:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10AmlrCkadYUXmsM-YxMh9_1mwjxmKjFE/edit#slide=id.p1
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YFXB_6Xxa6uPo9jqigzgn86rU7J91wP0/edit

We have presented to WG chair on our 3 approaches from our gap analysis:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nyBHUIlxNQwcUNJzYrfVoXEQ6bjJtKSA7k9e3AzGBrQ/edit#slide=id.g243fa198950_1_395
We had 3 principle conclusions:

Continue Datacenter/cloud computing ecosystem discussion in DC SIG
Proxy ISA infrastructure for DC in other existing architectural groups
Start an Acceelerator SIG that would champion RV as an accelerator (there are already many examples from Esperanto, Ventana,  Andes, TensTorrent, etc)



•	Our drive:
o	datacenter+cloud-computing SIG - Google Drive
•	As discussed in the AI from the Mar 7 call, we have created a Technical Whitepaper template from which we will give detailed writeups on each feature in our Gap list. All this is in the RISCV DC/CC folder where you should all have write access if you are part of RISC-V: o datacenter+cloud-computing SIG - Google Drive
•	We have started with several documents from which the DC/CC SIG members can copy for each feature (or they may combine feature into a major topic), and allow other members to help with the writing: 
•	Original template: 
o	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UAk33wi3NMElGM_zCekdPa5eFRJCVQIaK1VhvQ3M67Q/edit
