# Agenda

- Agenda
  - Today I would like to involve Dr. Liuxi Yang for sharing their work on RISCV server chip SG2042.
Here is Dr. Yang's bio:

Liuxi Yang is the Chief Scientist at Sohgo Technologies. Prior to joining Sohgo, he worked for several computer system companies, including SGI, SUN Microsystems, Sanera Systems, Sonoa Systems, Teradata, and Spreadtrum Communications. 
Yang played an integral role in multiple successful microprocessor design projects, including those utilizing MIPS, SPARC, ARM, and RISC-V architectures. Yang earned his Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

We can have a discussion during/after his presentation and share ideas or views with each other,  e.g. challenges, experiences, real needs and plan etc.

 - Standing items

We have iterated on our NON-ISA plan for the last 3 month (since November 2021), and it is stabilizing with fewer changes. So now is the time to start writing our technical thoughts down concretely so that we can keep and maintain our institutional knowledge.
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RBcRB41d0qZsVP6TrE9jnsPUQyoE493mgOoL75m5jeQ/edit#slide=id.g11528f3be56_0_19

As discussed in the AI from the Mar 7 call, we have created a Technical Whitepaper template from which we will give detailed writeups on each feature in our Gap list. All this is in the RISCV DC/CC folder where you should all have write access if you are part of RISC-V:
o	datacenter+cloud-computing SIG - Google Drive

Disussed with Ventana (JM) using a website for the  ecosyste paper so that it is live.
