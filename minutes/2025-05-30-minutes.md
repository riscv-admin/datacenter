# Minutes
In the meeting, we share and discusse the experiences and practices of RAS (Reliability, Availability, Serviceability) technologies in cloud for both x86 and ARM architectures. It covers full-stack hardware-software collaborative technical solutions (encompassing hardware, firmware, kernel, and application layers), upstream open-source contributions of RAS tools (including development tools and test cases), Alibaba Cloud's work on fault prediction (referencing the HPCA 2025 paper), and cooperation with NVIDIA in GPU-related RAS optimizations.

See: https://github.com/riscv-admin/datacenter/blob/main/minutes/Experiences%20and%20Proposals%20on%20RAS%20for%20RISC-V%20in%20Public%20Cloud.pdf

Additionally, two proposals regarding synchronization error handling combined with RISC-V are put forward. The plan is to continue promoting cooperation with SIG/TGs or propose new TG to supplement technical capabilities in the RISC-V RAS, and further enhance support in specifications, firmware, and kernel layers.
